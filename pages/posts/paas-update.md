# PaaS Update
My (this) website was gone offline for couple of days, that because my subscription on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) has ended,
and I decide to migrate to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

And my community (Hyperion Foundation) websites were hosted by using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) service too, so I was thinking "Why not I migrate my community websites to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) too?" ðŸ˜….

So that's just a heads-up for this post.
